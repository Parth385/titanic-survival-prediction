# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using **Logistic Regression**. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and model persistence.

The project was built using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and follows industry-standard Scikit-Learn practices such as preprocessing pipelines and cross-validation.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses were performed:

* Target variable distribution
* Numerical feature distributions
* Categorical feature distributions
* Survival analysis across different features
* Correlation analysis
* Family Size feature engineering

# Data Preprocessing

Implemented an automated preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-Learn.

### Numerical Pipeline

* Median Imputation
* Standard Scaling

### Categorical Pipeline

* Most Frequent Imputation
* One-Hot Encoding
* ColumnTransformer

# Key Findings

* Passenger sex was the strongest predictor of survival.
* Higher fares were associated with higher survival probability.
* Older passengers had a slightly lower chance of survival.
* The Logistic Regression model generalized well with minimal overfitting.
